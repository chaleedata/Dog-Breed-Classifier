# Project Overview
Convolutional Neural Network was built to classify dog breeds by user-supplied images.It not like neural networks which see images differently than humans. they see images as pixels.The objective is given an image dog,The algorithm can identify of the canineâ€™s breed.

# Convolutional Neural Networks have 2 main components.
1.Feature learning: convolution, ReLU,Pooling layer phases here. Edges,shades,lines,curves, in this Feature learning step are get extracted.
2. Classification: I will assign a probability for the object on the image being what the algorithm predicts it is.
